Reverse-dependencies:

* This release reorganises some parts of a low-level semi-public
  API. All my packages that do are ready to go, and I had notified
  maintainers of other reverse-depends back on 10 April 2018. This
  release has been developed in a public repository, with everyone
  having access to the development source code since around this time
  last year.

* However, I have made an effort to provide backwards-compatibility
  shims that emulate the old API while providing deprecation
  warnings. As a result, the packages using the deprecated APIs may
  produce a large number deprecation warnings. I have implemented a
  mechanism by which each function only issues such a warning the
  first time it's called, however.

* Some methods (e.g., summary.formula()) should no longer exported but
  rather be registered using S3method. I am forcing them to be
  exported for now, with a deprecation warning if they are called
  directly rather than through a generic or getS3method().

* All reverse- dependencies, suggests, and enhances except for
  ergm.ego and tergm run through the R CMD check on my
  system. ergm.ego and tergm are maintained by me.

NOTEs:

* ergm is released under GPLv3 with attribution clause provided in
  file LICENSE.

* Of the non-methods that look like methods (coef.length.model,
  plot.mcmc.list.ergm, plot.network.ergm, and summary.statistics), all
  three are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.

Other items:

* The vignette may take some time to build.
